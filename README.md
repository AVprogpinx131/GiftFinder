# Find your perfect birthday gifts

### Overview 
Made a simple Rust CLI game with inquire library. Check out library Github repo [here](https://github.com/mikaelmello/inquire).

### Game logic 
The customer gets a certain amount of money after selecting his birthday date from the calendar. If your birthday is in the weekend, we add 100-300$ (used rand library to generate random number) to the customers account as a bonus. 

Then the customer enters the shop and has the ability to choose gifts according to his interest and collected money (if not enough money, then the customer has to choose a different gift from the options).

After the purchase the customer may buy another item, but can also leave the shop. 

In the end the customer gets a check (sort of) with all the bought items. 

### Outcome 
Its a great project to learn the power and fundamentals about Rust data structures.
